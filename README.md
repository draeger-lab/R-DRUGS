# R-DRUGS
Rationalized Discovery of Robust antiviral targets Using Genome-scale model Systems

- The scripts are numbered according to their order of execution. 
- We used jupyter notebooks and matlab scripts. 
- Influenza was used as an example. However, all other viruses were processed, evaluated, and analyzed in the same way. 
- For the CoreModels and CoreReactions, only a few files were uploaded for the sake of storage space. All files can be generated by using the provided code. 
- The matlab models are uploaded as compressed files.

#### To convert hierarchical models defined with the Hierarchical Model Composition package into their "flattened" versions use the script within the `flatteningScript` directory.
