The reconstructed models contain two sets of exchange reactions, one in the (e) compartment and one in the (u) compartment. The reactions occurring within the (u) compartment encompass cell types that interface with multiple environments simultaneously. However, these reactions do not impact our computational results as they only involve exchange reactions with a lower bound of zero, allowing only for compound outflow.
